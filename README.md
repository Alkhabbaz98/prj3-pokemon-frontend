<h1>Project's Technological Content</h1>
<p>The website's main technology that have been used is REACT for the front-end and MEN Stack for the back-end. REACT is the core of the website as it is took care of the user interface with a combination of components to structure the website such as NavBar, PokemonList, PokemonDetails...etc. 
In order to make the website function as a full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete), it was linked and combined with MongoDB which allowed to store all data related to the Pokemon team, username, and a password for each user.
 </p>
<br>
<p>In addition, CSS has been implemented to design and make changes to the website. For example, one of the techiques that have been used is 
whenever the user hovers on any of the NavBar options, the option will change color. Overall, css have been use to make the website look decently and related to Pokemon. </p>
